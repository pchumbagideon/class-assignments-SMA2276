The project aims to develop a stopwatch application using  c++ thhat 
accurately measures the elapsed time between two points in a program.
The stopwatch will be implemented using the high resolution clock class
from the 11c++ chrono library, allowing for precise timing measurements 
in microseconds. The program will allow the user to start and stop the 
stopwatch at any point during the program excecution and calculate the elapsed
time in seconds or milliseconds. The application will include features  such as 
 the ability to stop and resume the stopwatch, record split times and
print the timing results to the console or a file.
